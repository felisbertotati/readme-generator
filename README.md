# README Genarator

## Description:

In this project I have to create an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a hogh-quality README for the app. This README I have to include the app's purpose, how to use, how to install it, how to report issues and how ro make contributions. With this project I can easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one allow me to have more time to work in the future projects. This application won't be deployed, so I will provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates it's functionality.
